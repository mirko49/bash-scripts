This is a script was based on http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/linux-and-open-source/how-to-automatically-rename-and-reorder-mp3-files/

This script searches for mp3 files in a directory and moves them to another folder by changing their names and folder structure using their id3v2 tags. 

This script was modified because it was not working at first, now using id3v2. 

I must say that my knowledge in Bash is not much and only seek to learn and share knowledge
